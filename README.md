# EVOlution - iOS

The goal of this project is for the version 1.0 was: bring to iOS the experience provided by Swift Evolution [website](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution).

Swift Evolution is the process by which changes and enhancements to the Swift programming language are proposed, discussed, and ultimately accepted or rejected. It is an open and transparent process that involves the Swift community, including both Apple engineers and the broader developer community.

Now we are shifting from the basic idea to make it more social. 

On our roadmap (you can read at our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Evolution-App/iOS/projects/2)), we have some notes for the future, which will cover stuff like: Follow Proposals starring or watching them, Follow Authors and/or Review Managers, List of most popular proposals, featured proposals and other ideas coming from the community.
