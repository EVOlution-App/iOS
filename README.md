# EVOlution - iOS

The goal of this project for version 1.0 was bring to iOS the experience provided by Swift Evolution [website](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution).

Now we are shifting from the basic idea to make it more social. 

On our roadmap (you can read at our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Evolution-App/iOS/projects/2)), we have some notes for the future, which will cover stuff like: Follow Proposals starring or watching them, Follow Authors and/or Review Managers, List of most popular proposals, featured proposals and other ideas coming from the community.
