EVOlution - iOS
Welcome to EVOlution, an iOS app designed to enrich your experience with the Swift Evolution process. Initially launched to mirror the content found on the Swift Evolution website, EVOlution is now transitioning towards incorporating more social features, aimed at fostering a community around Swift's ongoing development.

EVOlution App Interface

Introduction
Since its inception, EVOlution's mission has been to provide Swift developers and enthusiasts with an intuitive and interactive platform to engage with Swift Evolution proposals. With version 1.0, we focused on delivering comprehensive access to proposals, their statuses, and discussions. As we evolve, our goal shifts towards making EVOlution a social hub where users can follow proposals, authors, and review managers, discover popular and featured proposals, and share insights directly from the community.

The goal of this project is for the version 1.0 was: bring to iOS the experience provided by Swift Evolution [website](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution).

Now we are shifting from the basic idea to make it more social. 

On our roadmap (you can read at our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Evolution-App/iOS/projects/2)), we have some notes for the future, which will cover stuff like: Follow Proposals starring or watching them, Follow Authors and/or Review Managers, List of most popular proposals, featured proposals and other ideas coming from the community.
